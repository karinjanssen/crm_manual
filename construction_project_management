Construction projects for the City of Spokane are initially vetted by the Integrated Capital Management (ICM) team. When financial viability has been established, the project is transferred to the office of the City Engineer (currently Dan Buller). The City Engineer will coordinate the design phase of the project with his engineering team. Once the design phase is complete and the project has been successfully bid, the project moves to the construction phase.
